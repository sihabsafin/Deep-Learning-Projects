# 🤖 AI Customer Churn Predictor

A production-ready **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** application that predicts customer churn in the banking sector.  
Built with **TensorFlow** and deployed using **Streamlit**, this project focuses on **real-world inference, explainability, and business decision-making**, not just model training.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Customer churn directly impacts revenue in the banking and fintech industry.  
This application transforms raw customer data into **actionable business insights** by combining:

- ANN-based churn prediction
- Risk interpretation (Low / Medium / High)
- Explainable AI (lightweight, business-friendly)
- Decision-driven recommendations

This is not a demo — it’s a **deployable AI product**.
